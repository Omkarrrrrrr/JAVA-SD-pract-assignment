Fundamentals of Java Assignment 2

1) what  is statically typed vs dynamically typed programming language?
- Statically typed: Programming languages are referred to as "Static typed" if the
memory of the variable is provided at the time of compilation.
For instance, C, C++, and Java

-Dynamically typed: Programming languages are said to as "dynamically typed"
if the memory for the variable is provided at the time of execution.
Like Python, PHP, and JavaScript

2)What is the variable in java?
- ● A variable is the name of a memory-allocated reserved area. It may be thought of as
the name of a memory location, in other words.

● While the Java programme is running, the value is held in a container.

● To identify the storage location, each variable needs to have a special name.

● A data type is assigned to a variable 

3)How to assign a value in variable ?
- value can be assigned to a variable using Assignment operator.
- ex . int myNumber = 42;
- here assignment operator is used to  store the value 42 in 'myNumber' variable which is of integer data type.

4) What are premitive data types un java?
- A primitive type is predefined by the language and is named by a reserved keyword.
- Primitive data types: The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte,
short, int, long, float and double.

5)What are identifiers in java?
- An identifier is a name given to a package, class, interface, method, or variable. All identifiers must have different names.

6)List the operators in java?
- Java supports a variety of operators that can be classified into several categories. Here is a list of operators in Java:
1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Relational Operators
3. Logical Operators
4. Assignment Operators
5. Unary Operators
6. Bitwise Operators

7) Explain about increment and decrement operators and give an example 
- Increment and decrement operators are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1, respectively. These operators are often denoted as ++ (increment) and -- (decrement).

● Increment Operator (++):
The increment operator increases the value of a variable by 1. It can be used as a prefix (++i) or a postfix (i++) operator.

ex :
int i = 5;
++i; // Increment i by 1
System.out.println("After increment: " + i); // Output: 6

// Or using the postfix increment
int j = 10;
j++; // Increment j by 1
System.out.println("After increment: " + j); // Output: 11


● Decrement Operator (--):
The decrement operator decreases the value of a variable by 1. Like the increment operator, it can be used as a prefix (--i) or a postfix (i--) operator.

ex:
int x = 8;
--x; // Decrement x by 1
System.out.println("After decrement: " + x); // Output: 7

// Or using the postfix decrement
int y = 15;
y--; // Decrement y by 1
System.out.println("After decrement: " + y); // Output: 14
