1) what is an interface in java
- An interface in Java is a mechanism that is used to achieve complete abstraction. It is basically a kind of
class that contains only constants and abstract methods.

2)Which modifiers are allowed for methods in an Interface?Explain with an example
- Only abstract and public modifiers are allowed for methods in interfaces.

- 
// Defining an interface with abstract method and public access-->>

public interface Shape {
    // Abstract method (implicitly abstract and public)
    void draw();

    // Default method (public by default)
    default void display() {
        System.out.println("Displaying shape.");
    }
}

// Implementing classes
class Circle implements Shape {
    // Implementing the abstract method
   
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing circle.");
    }
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    // Implementing the abstract method
   
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing rectangle.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape circle = new Circle();
        Shape rectangle = new Rectangle();

        circle.draw();      
        circle.display();   

        rectangle.draw();   
        rectangle.display(); 
    }
}

3) what is use of interface in java?
- i) interface is used to acheive full abstraction
  ii) Using interfaces is the best way to expose our projectâ€™s API to some other project.
  iii) Programmers use interfaces to customise features of software differently for different objects.
  iv) By using interface, we can achieve the functionality of multiple inheritance.

  4) Difference between abstract class and interfaces in java
  -
               Abstract class           |          Interface
    1)Abstract class have abstract and  | 1)Only have abstract methods and since java 8
    non abstract methods                |   it can have default and static method also
                                        |
    2)doesnt support multiple inherit-  | 2) supports multiple inheritance
    ance                                |
                                        |
    3) can have final,non-final,static  | 3) has only static and final variables
    and non static variable             |
                                        |
    4) can provide implementation of    | 4) cant provide implementation of interfaces
       interface                        |
                                        |
    5) abstract keyword is used to      | 5)interface keyword used to declare
       abstract class                   |
                                        |
    6)can extend another java class and | 6)an interface can extend another java interface only
      implement multiple java interfaces|   
                                        |
    7) an abstract class extended using | 7) interface can be implemented using keyword "implements"
     keyword "extends"                  |
                                        |
    8) java abstract class can have     |8) members of java interface are public only
       class private protected
