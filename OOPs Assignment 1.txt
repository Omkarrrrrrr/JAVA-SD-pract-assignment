OOPs Assignment 1


1) how can we create object in java:
- In Java, we can create an object by-

Declare a Class: Define a class that describes the attributes and behaviors of the object you want to create.

Instantiate the Class: Use the new keyword followed by a call to the class constructor to create a new instance of the class.

ex.public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of Car class
        Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla");
       .
       .
       .

    }

2) why 'new' keyword is used in java?
- In Java, the new keyword is primarily used to dynamically allocate memory for an object at runtime. When we use new, you are essentially creating a new instance of a class
- Creating Objects: The most common use of new is to create instances of classes. When we declare a variable of a class type and assign it using new, memory is allocated for the object, and the constructor of the class is called to initialize the object.


- ex. MyClass obj = new MyClass(); // Creates a new instance of MyClass


3)what are different variables in java?
- Based on the behaviour and position of declaration all variables are divided into the following 3 types.

Instance variables 

Static variables 

Local variables

4) what is the difference between instance variables and local variables?
- 
instance variables-->
belong to objects of a class and have a longer lifetime compared to local variables, which are temporary and exist only within a specific scope. Instance variables are accessible throughout the class
-They can have access modifiers such as public, private, or protected, which control their visibility and accessibility from other classes.
- Memory is allocated for instance variables when an object of the class is created using the new keyword.
-They are automatically initialized with default values if not explicitly initialized. The default values depend on the variable's data type.

Local variables -->
- while local variables are accessible only within the block, method, or constructor in which they are declared.
- They cannot have access modifiers.
- Memory is allocated for local variables when the method, constructor, or block in which they are declared is executed
-They must be explicitly initialized before they are used. They do not have default values and will result in a compilation error if accessed without initialization.


5)In which area memory is allocated for local and instance variables?
- Local variables are stored on the stack and have a short lifespan, existing only within the scope of the method, constructor, or block in which they are declared.
-Instance variables are stored on the heap and have a longer lifespan, existing as long as the object they belong to exists

6)What is method overloading in java?
- Method overloading enables several methods to use the same name but have distinct signatures, where the signature might vary based on the quantity, nature, or combination of input arguments.

- But in java we can take multiple methods with the same name and different 
argument types. 
abs(int) for int datatype
abs(long) for long datatype
abs(float) for float datatype
